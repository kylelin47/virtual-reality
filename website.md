# [Project 1 - Interactive Narrative or Game](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocJ9t-0BbPVUraQDg9rHS56NjaOMTNZMMRlIqh53YPI/edit)
## Motivation and Explanation
Our project was motivated by Chapter 1 of the book "The VR Book", by Jason Jerald, which states
> The recent surge in media coverage about VR has inspired the public to become quite excited about its potential. This coverage has focused on the entertainment industry, specifically video games and immersive film. VR is a great fit for the entertainment industry and will certainly be the driving force behind VR in the short term.

and

> VR has been successfully deployed in various industries for many years now. Successful applications include . . . theme-park entertainment

We wanted to create an experience that simulates theme-park entertainment (specifically, a haunted house) where the theme is immersive film.
Each room (scene) in the haunted house would be inspired by a different iconic horror movie, and the visitor would need to successfully complete
some tasks in order to, for example, escape a killer, or in some other way advance the 'plot' of that scene.

The first scene in our VR experience was inspired by "Friday the 13th". The user starts off outside a haunted house, and walks in through the
door. He gets locked inside a room, and start hearing spooky sounds. You pick up a "weapon" and then Jason appears, scares you, then disappears.
We then transition to a scene inspired by "The Grudge". You start off on the ground floor of the haunted house, and you walk up the stairs.
Upon entering any room, the Grudge appears and turns to look at you. In the bathroom, the Grudge appears in the toilet, and you flush her down
the toilet. After this happens, the Grudge no longer appears in the rooms. The final scene was inspired by "The Exorcist". 

We felt this was a good fit for a VR experience primarily because of how it strongly leverages stereoscopic rendering and head tracking.
The user is required to be able to freely look around the environments and closely inspect all objects. The first scene, where
the user is running from an assailant, requires that they be able to easily navigate around the environment, along with being able
to accurately judge the position of the chaser. Jump scares should feel as if they're actually directly in front of the user. Essentially,
experiences designed to surprise or scare you benefit greatly from the user feeling present in the experience, which is one of the main
advantages of VR technology.

In addition, because we picked supernatural horror films the 'virtual' in virtual reality is needed because it simulates an experience that
might otherwise be impossible to replicate using conventional reality.
