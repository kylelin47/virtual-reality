This coverage has focused on the entertainment industry, specifically video games and immersive film. VR is a great fit for the entertainment industry and will certainly be the driving force behind VR in the short term.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> VR has been successfully deployed in various industries for many years now. Successful applications include . . . theme-park entertainment\r\n\r\nWe wanted to combine the two ideas of theme-park entertainment and immersive film by making a haunted house where the theme is immersive film.\r\nEach scene in the haunted house would be inspired by a different iconic horror movie, and the visitor would need to successfully complete\r\nsome tasks in order to, for example, escape a killer, or in some other way advance the 'plot' of that scene.\r\n\r\nThe first scene in our VR experience was inspired by \"Friday the 13th\". The user starts off outside a haunted house, and walks in through the\r\ndoor. He gets locked inside a room, and start hearing spooky sounds. You pick up a \"weapon\" and then Jason appears, scares you, then disappears.\r\nWe then transition to a scene inspired by \"The Grudge\". You start off on the ground floor of the haunted house, and you walk up the stairs.\r\nUpon entering any room, the Grudge appears and turns to look at you. In the bathroom, the Grudge appears in the toilet, and you flush her down\r\nthe toilet. After this happens, the Grudge no longer appears in the rooms. The final scene was inspired by \"The Exorcist\". A girl is sitting\r\non a bed and her head is spinning, while dark spirits float in the air around her. The user must ring the bell, read from the book, and\r\nlight the candle in order for the spirits to leave.\r\n\r\nWe felt this was a good fit for a VR experience because of how it strongly leverages stereoscopic rendering and head tracking.\r\nThe user is required to be able to freely look around the environments and closely inspect all objects. The user must also be able to\r\neasily navigate around the environment, and accurately judge the position of various scares and objects in order to successfully avoid or\r\ninteract with them. Jump scares should feel as if they're actually directly in front of the user. Experiences designed to surprise or scare you\r\nbenefit greatly from the user feeling present in the experience, which is one of the main advantages of VR technology.\r\n\r\nIn addition, because we envisioned our scenes as requiring user input in order to advance the plot, it's an experience that couldn't be\r\nreplicated using simply film. And, because we picked supernatural horror films, the 'virtual' in virtual reality is needed (instead of simply\r\ncreating a haunted house) because it would be near impossible to replicate using conventional reality.\r\n\r\n## The Experience\r\n[Youtube video of the experience](http://youtube.com)\r\n\r\n[Source code and executable](http://github.com)\r\n\r\n## Non-Student Created Assets\r\n### Scene 2\r\n#### Audio\r\n| Title | Author | Source |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Dripping Water | jesuisaimu | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXiedMJdsV4 |\r\n| Scary Ominous Creepy Dark Ambient Horror Music | ANRmusicvideos | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXkGE-k2_EU |\r\n| Toilet Flush | Soundfxforfree | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JJ700tVT_0 |\r\n\r\n#### Models and Textures\r\n| Title | Author | Source |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| The Grudge | gunter0924 | http://www.123dapp.com/creature/The-Grudge/3372829 |\r\n| The Modern Tudor House - Fully Furnished | Cordelle | https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=e1922f9f6daadcb87a7f613ed951587c |\r\n\r\n### Scene 3\r\n#### Audio\r\n| Title | Author | Source |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Ave, Maria | St. Benedict's Monastery | http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/music/gregorian-chant/chant-liturgical-year/christus-rex-selected-chants.html |\r\n| Creaking Door Spooky Sound | stephan | http://soundbible.com/1717-Creaking-Door-Spooky.html |\r\n| Fire Burning Sound | JaBa | http://soundbible.com/1902-Fire-Burning.html |\r\n| Ship Brass Bell Sound | Mike Koenig | http://soundbible.com/1745-Ship-Brass-Bell.html |\r\n| Tubular Bells (Exorcist Theme) | Mike Oldfield | http://www.amazon.com/Tubular-Bells-Mike-Oldfield/dp/B000000WG4 |\r\n\r\n#### Models and Textures\r\n| Name | Author | Source |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Bell, copper | Chigirinsky | https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=aa20fa2c82a588d381b0d56f7467d8ca |\r\n| Books | VIS Games | https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3356 |\r\n| Candle | 3dDude | https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=651409afa17ef4b81bbf1f546b411095 |\r\n| Dementor | Luna Zechnas | https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=8c4db2769aa8e7ae701039b5ef7fcf8b |\r\n| Free Furniture Set | Lef | https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26678 |\r\n| Old Open Book | prometheus | https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=add68331da20e578b31ece83d837aa19 |\r\n| Shanty Town: Brick Wall Wet | Unity Technologies | https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/75 |\r\n| Sleeping bed | Vertex Studio | https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/8329 |\r\n| Wood texture floor | Antonio Neves | https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/24970 |\r\n\r\n## Team Members\r\n- Sabrina Gutierrez - Scene 1\r\n- Zane Hooper - Scene 2\r\n- Kyle Lin - Scene 3\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
